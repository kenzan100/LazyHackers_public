This is a RoR application I tried to scale up but due to team member reason, failed for now.
I still think this would work as a concept(some user still keeps using it),
so decided to make it a public repo so anyone interested can see.

working site you can see at:
http://lazyhackers.com

if you try to pull and test it out, you need
1. set up your own production database
2. set up your own email action mailer setting

plus, some of the code was hard-coded, so the lack of data
might cause error(oh you are better fixing than me).

if anything, contact me at
